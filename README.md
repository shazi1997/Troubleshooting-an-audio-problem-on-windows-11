<h1>How to trouble shoot an audio flickering error</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Ever had an audio flickering error when connecting your headset to your laptop? In this project I am going to be running over the steps needed to troubleshoot this issue. The headset I am going to be using is the Sony inzone H7, however this concept can be used for any gaming headset connected to your device.

<h2>What is the problem? </h2>
When connecting your Sony Inzone H7 headset to your laptop, you notice that the sound bar on the bottom right flicks from on and off. There is also no audio output from the headset when it is powered on. 

<h2>Troubleshooting steps:</h2>
1. Well, firstly you would want to diognose the root cause of this problem. To do this try plugging your sony inzone H7 onto another device such as your playstation or another laptop. If the headset works perfectly fine on another device, this indicates that the problem is not with the firmware on the headset but the computer you are using.

2. When opening device manager, the flickering persists on there as well with the drop down boxes expanding and collapsing. The same behaviour is observed in playback devices (control panel - hardware and sound -  sound). This indicates that the issues may be with the drivers.

3. Next boot your computer into safe mode, this only loads the essential drivers and services. This will most likely cause the constant flickering to stop. Then unistall everything under sound, video and game controllers especially your headsets driver. Do not worry when restarting the computer, windows will load fresh new drivers, replacing the faulty old ones. This should help fix the problem when you restart your computer again.
